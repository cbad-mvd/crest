								<h1 class="page-title">CREST EDUCATION CENTER</h1>
								<p>
									CREST Education Center is a school and therapy center for students ages 5 years to 22 years with mild, moderate or severe disabilities, including those who fall within the Autism Spectrum Disorder.
								</p>
								<p>
									CREST’s educational philosophy does not rely upon a specific approach but rather uses a diverse approach that allows each student to demonstrate their true ability and areas of interest rather than being defined by either their diagnosis or their symptomology.  As each student is unique, the approach to their educational experiences must be equally unique – a hallmark of CREST Education Center.
								</p>
								<p>
									The purpose of the program is to provide special education and therapies for students whose needs cannot, or are not, being met in their local school district.  Students who attend CREST Education Center are in an environment that allows them to maximize their potential and become productive members of society. The educational environment is designed to provide intensive, individualized instruction in all academic areas, making use of strengths while remediating areas of need.  Individual or small group therapies in the areas of speech, language, behavior and motor skills focus on further individualizing and intensifying their educational experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									The CREST experience is summarized in its acronym: Communication, Respect, Empowerment, Success, Teamwork.

									<p>
										CREST carries on a tradition and successful methodology created by two pioneers in the field of special education.  Over 60 years ago, long before the term autism was widely used, Aleen Agranowitz and Gladys Gleason started working with children who had speech and language difficulties.  The founders of CREST spent over 50 years working side by side with Aleen and Gladys in developing strategies to best meet the unique needs of their students.  CREST continues to embody the legacy of that work.

									<h6 class="topic-header ">The CREST Difference</h6>
									<p>
										The overlying hallmark of CREST is that there is no single approach to academic learning, communication, or behavior that meets the needs of every student.  Our belief is that as individuals our needs are met in distinct ways, our students are just as unique.  We realize that the use of peer-reviewed and well documented strategies is critical to our program design, while at the same time we also recognize the responsibility that we have to carefully and critically evaluate how each students’ needs can best be met.

									<h6 class="topic-header ">CREST Admissions</h6>
									<p>
										Students must be referred to CREST by their local school district prior to consideration for enrollment in CREST.  A current IEP and most recent evaluations will be reviewed by CREST staff to determine if goals and objectives can be addressed by educational program and therapies.  Parents and potential student are asked to meet with administrative staff, tour the program, and ask and answer questions.
