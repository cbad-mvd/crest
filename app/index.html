								<h1 class="page-title">CREST EDUCATION CENTER</h1>
								<p>
									CREST Education Center is a school and therapy center for students ages 5 years to 22
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				years with mild, moderate or severe disabilities, including those who fall within the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				Autism Spectrum Disorder.
								</p>
								<p>
									CREST’s educational philosophy does not rely upon a specific approach but rather uses a
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				diverse approach that allows each student to demonstrate their true ability and areas of
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				interest rather than being defined by either their diagnosis or their symptomology. As
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				each student is unique, the approach to their educational experiences must be equally
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				unique – a hallmark of CREST Education Center.
								</p>
								<p>
									The purpose of the program is to provide special education and therapies for students
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				whose needs cannot, or are not, being met in their local school district. Students who
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				attend CREST Education Center are in an environment that allows them to maximize their
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				potential and become productive members of society. The educational environment is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				designed to provide intensive, individualized instruction in all academic areas, making
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				use of strengths while remediating areas of need. Individual or small group therapies in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				the areas of speech, language, behavior and motor skills focus on further
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				individualizing and intensifying their educational experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									The CREST experience is summarized in its acronym: Communication, Respect, Empowerment,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				Success, Teamwork.

									<p>
										CREST carries on a tradition and successful methodology created by two pioneers in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	the field of special education.  Over 60 years ago, long before the term autism was
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	widely used, Aleen Agranowitz and Gladys Gleason started working with children who
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	had speech and language difficulties.  They pioneered therapeutic approaches based on individual needs while maintaining respect for every student. The founders of CREST spent over 50 years
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	working side by side with Aleen and Gladys...

									<h6 class="topic-header ">The CREST Difference</h6>
									<p>
										The overlying hallmark of CREST is that there is no single approach to academic
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	learning, communication, or behavior that meets the needs of every student. Our
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	belief is that as individuals our needs are met in distinct ways, our students are
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	just as unique. We realize that the use of peer-reviewed and well documented
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	strategies is critical to our program design, while at the same time we also
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	recognize the responsibility that we have to carefully and critically evaluate how
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	each students’ needs can best be met.

									<p>
										Students must be referred to CREST by their local school district prior to
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	consideration for enrollment in CREST. Although parents may attend a general tour of
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	the program, tours specific to the student are not scheduled without prior
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	approval/communication with the school district. A current IEP and most recent
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	evaluations will be reviewed by CREST staff to determine if goals and objectives can
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	be addressed by CREST’s educational program and therapies.
