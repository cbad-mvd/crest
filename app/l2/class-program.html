								<p>
									We recognize that as unique as each student is, the approach to their academic learning
																																																																																is equally unique. CREST’s philosophy about learning is not “cookie cutter” but rather
																																																																																utilizes any and all approaches and programs that allow each student to maximize their
																																																																																potential to learn.
								</p>
								<p>
									Curriculum materials are based on California Common Core with modifications to meet
																																																																																individual student needs as well as provide for alternative modifications. The use of
																																																																																technology, such as SmartBoards and specially designed curriculum aligned to Common Core
																																																																																(Unique Learning System) is implemented within the classroom curriculum. Our goal is to
																																																																																ensure that students have exposure to and are able to derive benefit from a general
																																																																																education curriculum, recognizing that for each student this benefit may be expressed in
																																																																																different ways. CREST also recognizes that each student learns at a different rate and
																																																																																often has abilities that may far exceed their grade level placement. CREST is dedicated
																																																																																to allow for continued growth in areas of excellence while continuing to focus on
																																																																																identified needs. Specific academic targets are identified through an IEP process, are a
																																																																																focus during instructional periods, with growth measured by accurate data collection. As
																																																																																an outgrowth of our philosophy, we also recognize and encourage alternative ways that
																																																																																our students are able to express their learning.
								</p>
								<p>
									Specific components of the program include:
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Classroom Academics:</strong>
									Basic literacy (including recognition and comprehension of written material),
																																																																																mathematics (number recognition, calculation and processes), science, and social
																																																																																sciences. Curriculum materials are based on those utilized for students in general
																																																																																education settings based on California Common Core with specific modifications to
																																																																																accommodate the needs of the students in the program. This ensures that students have
																																																																																exposure to and are able to benefit from a typical classroom curriculum. Additional
																																																																																California State Department of Education approved curriculum designed specifically for
																																																																																students with special needs is also utilized.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Social Skill Development:</strong>
									Students who are unable to communicate effectively often resort to behaviors as an
																																																																																attempt to get their needs met. These students are often unaware of the effect that
																																																																																their behaviors have on others and do not recognize they are often effectively removing
																																																																																themselves from making and maintaining relationships with peers as well as adults.
																																																																																Developing a system of communication helps to ameliorate the behaviors but at the same
																																																																																time the students require specific education in developing appropriate social behaviors.
																																																																																By using appropriate peer modeling, feedback, and role-playing students are assisted in
																																																																																developing social skills that enable them to be a part of their various communities.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Sensory and Motor Skill Development:</strong>
									Many of the students present with impaired sensory systems, meaning that they do not
																																																																																process and coordinate basic sensory information. Specific therapies are designed to
																																																																																assist students in either sensitizing or de-sensitizing sensory input so they are better
																																																																																able to adjust to their environment. Additionally, students often do not develop gross
																																																																																motor skills that lead to participation in basic activities related to play (I.e.,
																																																																																hopping, skipping, jumping) and sport activities (i.e., basketball, baseball). These
																																																																																skill sets are established or progressed through daily activities in natural
																																																																																environments or in the gymnasium/multiple use room.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Communication/Language Development:</strong>
									Recognizing that communication is basic to the development of all academic and
																																																																																behavioral skills, a variety of approaches are utilized, including but not limited to
																																																																																verbal speech production, sign language, and all forms of technology (i.e., programs
																																																																																designed for iPads). Behavioral concerns are approached based on analyzing the function
																																																																																of the behavior and then providing peer reviewed therapies.
								</p>
								<p>
									Activities, as described above, are presented in both the classroom environment and
																																																																																individual/small group therapies.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Classroom/Therapy Staff:</strong>
									Classroom activities are conducted by credentialed special education teachers with
																																																																																appropriate education and training in meeting the needs of students with autism or other
																																																																																related developmental activities. Therapists holding credentials/licenses in respective
																																																																																fields of expertise that may include speech/language therapy (Speech/Language
																																																																																Pathologists), Occupational Therapy (including expertise in sensory integration and fine
																																																																																motor skills), Gross Motor Skills (Adapted Physical Education Specialists) and Behavior
																																																																																(Certified Behavior Analysts) are also onsite. Therapies may also be delivered by
																																																																																appropriately certified interns or other recognized titles related to fields of
																																																																																expertise.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our credentialed, experienced, and professionally trained teachers collaborate with
																																																																																specialists (Speech Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Behavior Specialists) to
																																																																																deliver instruction using a variety of instructional strategies and multi-modality
																																																																																methodologies.
								</p>
								<p>
									In order to best emulate a typical educational environment, the educational and therapy
																																																																																activities are conducted during normal school hours (8:30 am – 2:30 pm), Monday through
																																																																																Friday, 180 days a year (as mandated by California Department of Education) with an
																																																																																additional 20 days for Extended School Year (sometimes referred to as Summer School).
