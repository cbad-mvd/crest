								<h4>Welcome to</h4>
								<h1 class="page-title">CREST EDUCATION CENTER</h1>
								<p>
									The purpose of CREST Education Center, Inc. is to provide special education and therapies to students whose needs cannot
																																																																								                                be, or are not being, met by their local school district. CREST is a licensed and accredited
																																																																								                                school and therapy center for students ages 4 years to 22 years who present with mild, moderate
																																																																								                                or severe disabilities, including those who fall within the definition of Autism Spectrum
																																																																								                                Disorder. These disabilities are demonstrated by delays in several developmental areas, including
																																																																								                                speech, language, learning, behavior and fine/gross motor skills. The educational environment
																																																																								                                is designed to provide intensive, individualized instruction in all academic areas, making
																																																																								                                use of strengths while remediating areas of need. Individual or small group therapies in
																																																																								                                the areas of speech, language, sensory processing, behavior and motor skills focus on further
																																																																								                                individualizing and intensifying students’ educational experience. The end result is students
																																																																								                                who have maximized their potential and are either able to return to a less restrictive environment
																																																																								                                (their local school) or become a productive member of society.

									<p class="copy ">
										CREST carries on a tradition and successful methodology created by two pioneers in the field of special education. Over 60
																																																																																                                    years ago, long before the term autism was widely used, Aleen Agranowitz and Gladys Gleason
																																																																																                                    started working with children who had speech and language difficulties. The founders
																																																																																                                    of CREST spent over 50 years working side by side with Aleen and Gladys in developing
																																																																																                                    strategies to best meet the unique needs of their students. CREST continues to embody
																																																																																                                    the legacy of that work.
