								<p>
									The overlying hallmark of CREST is that there is no single approach to academic
																																																																																																																				learning, communication, or behavior that meets the needs of every student. Our belief
																																																																																																																				is that as individuals our needs are met in distinct ways, our students are just as
																																																																																																																				unique. We realize that the use of peer-reviewed and well documented strategies is
																																																																																																																				critical to our program design, while at the same time we also recognize the
																																																																																																																				responsibility that we have to carefully and critically evaluate how each students’
																																																																																																																				needs can best be met.
								</p>
							</p>
							<p>
								With the recognition that our Non-public school provides a very specific program to meet
																																																																																																								the needs of students who require a learning environment different from what has been
																																																																																																								available to them, we have chosen our name, CREST, to exemplify that difference.
							</p>
							<p>The acronym CREST, as well as our logo, symbolizes the philosophy behind our Non-public
																																																																																																								school. Our logo demonstrates that it takes a team (school staff, parents, districts,
																																																																																																								agencies) to reach the crest, coming from two sides to finally meet at the “top”.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our acronym clearly identifies the components necessary for the team:
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Communication</strong>
								forms the basis of our program. We recognize that communication is the foundation of
																																																																																																								learning – not just verbal (speech) but all aspects that allows our students to exchange
																																																																																																								ideas, emotions, knowledge, desires and so forth. Communication takes many forms at
																																																																																																								CREST. It may be verbal, written, gestural, pictured, signed, facilitated or any
																																																																																																								combination of each modality that allows every student to express themselves. In
																																																																																																								addition to facilitating and developing a system of communication for each student,
																																																																																																								CREST promotes education and training of those primary communication partners (classroom
																																																																																																								staff, parents, care providers, siblings). Communication transcends all environments and
																																																																																																								is critical to the development of every individual. Beyond the importance of
																																																																																																								communication for our students, CREST is also committed to encouraging and welcoming
																																																																																																								open communication between staff, parents, school districts and relevant agencies.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Respect</strong>
								for the individual student, for the parent and for the staff is paramount to growth for
																																																																																																								all those who are a part of our students’ lives. Respect for abilities, respect for
																																																																																																								growth (to whatever level), respect for the opinions of all involved, and respect for
																																																																																																								the uniqueness and the contributions of every individual.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Empowerment</strong>
								for each individual involved in CREST, student and adult alike. Each is empowered to
																																																																																																								speak for themselves (however they may speak), to recognize that they can make changes
																																																																																																								that benefit them as well as the program, and to recognize that they can make a
																																																																																																								difference in their life as well as the lives of others.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Success</strong>
								is measured in whatever form it takes, but is recognized as success. Whether it is a
																																																																																																								first word spoken, signed, written; using a calculator to determine dollars needed to
																																																																																																								make a purchase; performing a science experiment, reading a piece of literature or a
																																																																																																								recipe, or hitting a ball….each is measured as success for that individual student. Our
																																																																																																								staff and parent success is measured also by the realization that every positive change
																																																																																																								is a move towards the “CREST”.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Teamwork</strong>
								is critical to every aspect of the CREST program. Progress is not made in a vacuum and
																																																																																																								is not attributed to a single person. Success is measured by the result of dedicated
																																																																																																								work by teachers, therapists, aides, parents/care-providers and any others who recognize
																																																																																																								and are committed to the growth of our students. We never forget that the students are
																																																																																																								as integral part of the team and ultimately demonstrate the results of the work of each
																																																																																																								member of the team.
							</p>
							<p>
								The CREST team commits itself to never underestimate the abilities of each of its
																																																																																																								students. And most of all to always apply the philosophy that CREST teaches the way our
																																																																																																								students learn.
