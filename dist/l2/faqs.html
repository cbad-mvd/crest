								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What is the philosophy of CREST?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									CREST’s philosophy is based on the belief that as each student is unique, the approach to their educational experiences must be equally unique.  In recognition of this CREST does not rely upon one specific approach but rather uses diverse approaches that allows each student to demonstrate their true ability and areas of interest rather than being defined by either their diagnosis or their symptomology.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>How does CREST interface with public schools?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									As a Non-public school, CREST contracts with individual public school districts to provide programs and services to students with disabilities.   Students are enrolled through an IEP process and not directly by parents.  Students continue to be monitored by their local school district and remain under their jurisdiction.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What is the tuition at CREST?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									The tuition at CREST is covered completely by the contracting school district. Parents/guardians may be asked to provide support for incidental classroom supplies, field trips, or other activities not directly aligned with IEP’s.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What districts does CREST contract with?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									CREST is able to contract with any school district in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside or San Bernardino counties.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>Who determines IEP goals for students enrolled at CREST?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									IEP goals are written by the CREST team working with the parent and/or student with input from the contracting district.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What is the district involvement after a student is enrolled in CREST?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									The referring school district continues to be involved with the student. They are involved in triennial assessments, administer IEP meetings, and conduct observations of the student in the school environment.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What grades/age groups are served by CREST?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									CREST is certified to serve children from the age of 5 years to 21 (or 22 depending on birthdate) years of age.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What are the qualifications of CREST staff?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									As a certified Non-public school, CREST’s staff must be credentialed and certified by the appropriate credentialing/certifying agency.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What services are provided at CREST?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Speech/language therapy, occupational therapy and behavior intervention services are provided per IEP’s.  Additional services may be added to CREST’s certification as needed.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What is the ratio of student to adult in classrooms?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									A maximum of 3 students to each adult is maintained in each classroom.  This ratio may often be as low as 1:1 depending on individual aides assigned to students or general needs of the classroom.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What are the disabilities of the students who typically attend CREST?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Students on the Autism Spectrum and related developmental disabilities form the basis of those placed in CREST.  These students may present with challenges in academic learning, communication, social skills, gross and fine motor skills and behavior.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>How would my child qualify for admission to CREST?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Admission is determined on review of the goals, objectives and services outlined in his/her IEP.  If CREST is able to meet the IEP requirements the student is eligible to apply for admission following referral by their school district.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>Am I able to visit CREST without a referral from my school district?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									CREST does require a referral from the school district for a specific visit.  Generic monthly tours can be scheduled for a general overview of the program.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>How do I start the enrollment process?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									The enrollment process begins with a contact from the referring district indicating that they are considering placement in CREST.  IEP’s and assessments are provided and reviewed by CREST to determine if the placement would be appropriate.  Following that review, the referring school district is notified and an appointment is made for a visit by the parents, student, and school district.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What is the curriculum at CREST?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									The curriculum at CREST is based on research-based materials aligned with Common Core standards.  Modifications and accommodations are made based on individual student needs.  A variety of software programs, such as Unique Learning System, are also utilized to provide appropriate, individualized curriculum materials.  Standard text books, adopted by the California Department of Education are provided for student use.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>Does CREST have community-based experiences?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Community Based Instruction is an essential component of all grades at CREST.  While our transition aged students may have daily trips into the community our younger students may have monthly trips.  As CREST’s  philosophy is that each student is unique so is their community experience.  The amount of time and support level given to each student is personalized.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>What is the philosophy of handling behavior issues?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									CREST’s approach to behavior intervention is based on the needs of the individual. Our program uses a variety of treatment options that include the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Whatever approach, or combination of approaches, is determined to be most suitable, our goal is to increase appropriate social behaviors, communication, and learning readiness skills. Through positive reinforcement, CREST provides goal-focused treatment resulting in high student outcomes.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>How do parents/care providers communicate with CREST administration, teachers, and service providers?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Whether between school districts and administration or between teachers and parents, CREST considers communication to be a pivotal component of collaboration.  CREST uses an educational technology communication platform that teachers, students, and families can use to share important information regarding student daily performance, upcoming school events, and individual communication.
								</p>
								<p class="pgf-title">
									<strong>Does CREST have a visitation policy?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									CREST welcomes parents/caregivers and encourages them to visit their students’ classrooms and/or therapies. To ensure campus security as well as the continuity and integrity of instruction, parents interested in visiting are asked to follow visitation guidelines provided to them upon registration.
