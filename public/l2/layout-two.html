                        <p>
                            The purpose of CREST Education Center, Inc. is to provide special education and therapies to students whose needs cannot
                            be, or are not being, met by their local school district. CREST is a licensed and accredited
                            school and therapy center for students ages 4 years to 22 years who present with mild, moderate
                            or severe disabilities, including those who fall within the definition of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
                            These disabilities are demonstrated by delays in several developmental areas, including speech,
                            language, learning, behavior and fine/gross motor skills. The educational environment is designed
                            to provide intensive, individualized instruction in all academic areas, making use of strengths
                            while remediating areas of need. Individual or small group therapies in the areas of speech,
                            language, sensory processing, behavior and motor skills focus on further individualizing and
                            intensifying students’ educational experience. The end result is students who have maximized
                            their potential and are either able to return to a less restrictive environment (their local
                            school) or become a productive member of society.

                                CREST carries on a tradition and successful methodology created by two pioneers in the field of special education. Over 60
                                years ago, long before the term autism was widely used, Aleen Agranowitz and Gladys Gleason
                                started working with children who had speech and language difficulties. The founders of CREST
                                spent over 50 years working side by side with Aleen and Gladys in developing strategies to
                                best meet the unique needs of their students. CREST continues to embody the legacy of that
                                work.
